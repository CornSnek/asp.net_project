## Introduction
This is a capstone project for https://www.codecademy.com/ to build a web app with ASP.NET. I have used .NET 8.0 for this project instead of the .NET Core 3.1 the project was originally built with. This project was to read a sample sports league SQLite database and build web pages and models based from the data, using the concepts from the Build Web Apps with ASP.NET skill path.

To run the program, .NET 8.0 is required and it can be run with the command `dotnet.run`.
